<h2>This is an Abstract of HTML 4.01 Specification.</h2>
<q cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), 
the publishing language of the World Wide Web. 
This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. 
In addition to the text, multimedia, 
and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 [HTML32] and HTML 2.0 [RFC1866]), 
HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, 
better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. 
HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, 
with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide.<br>

HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 
-- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879].

<h1>Bidi Source Editing Prototype</h1>

<h3>Overview and Links</h3>

<p>Editing HTML or XML source that contains bidirectional (Arabic/Hebrew)
text is difficult.</p>

<p><a href="/cgi-bin/bidi-source-test">Testing Prototype (Web form)</a>:
Please try it out and provide feedback and comments!</p>

<h2>Documentation for Testing Prototype</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/cgi-bin/bidi-source-test">Testing Prototype</a> is a simple
Web form that allows you to try out how HTML or XML source code is displayed
using our research results, and to provide feedback for further improvement.
It should be possible to use the prototype without much instruction, but
below is a short description of each available option.</p>

<p>Your feedback will be most valuable if it answers one or more of the
following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you viewed or edited bidi HTML or XML previously? What was your
    experience?</li>
  <li>Does the display in the Result area look useful? Better than other
    things you have seen?</li>
  <li>Which options are useful, and which are unnecessary?</li>
  <li>Which options currently not provided would be useful?</li>
  <li>What kinds of documents are you viewing or editing (percentage of
    right-to-left and left-to-right text, use of Arabic or Hebrew element and
    attribute names)?</li>
  <li>How could we improve the Web form to make testing even easier?</li>
  <li>Which tools would you like better bidi source editing to be
  available?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Privacy</dt>
    <dd>This option allows you to indicate how you would like us to treat the
      source code that you submit for testing. The meaning of the options is
      as follows:
      <dl>
        <dt>throw-away</dt>
          <dd>We will not store the source you have submitted in any
          form.</dd>
        <dt>internal use</dt>
          <dd>We will use the source for internal analysis (maybe together
            with your feedback), but will not use it in publications.</dd>
        <dt>publishing okay</dt>
          <dd>You give us permission to use your example in publications.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>We will always store your feedback because otherwise, it wouldn't be
      feedback. Also, our server always stores log data for statistical
      analysis and server tuning.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Description for other options to follow.</dt>
